# Why should I use this plugin?
If you use CloudFlare in your Wordpress website and you want to boost it's performance, you need to set your Page Rule to "Cache Everything". Unfortunately, this will cache your whole website, homepage, post page and everytime you post/edit new content you'll have to manually purge your cache on CloudFlare's dashboard.

Currently, CloudFlare's provides a plugin for Wordpress but it just purge your cache in case of theme changes, not post changes.
So, if you are planning to BOOST your performance with CloudFlare, this plugin is what you need to avoid caching issues.
